This new repo is most up to date. However the old history/repo can be found here: https://github.com/Bonjour-ITWS/TableTime-Final_Build
This new repo was created due to files needing to convert into php rather than html. Hence in grading the overall history/participation of the project please also reference the old repo.


Please note: The email sending feature does genuinely work but a bug occured when merging everything into the final build. As such if you would like to see this feature in action please refer to the [Beta Release](https://github.com/Bonjour-ITWS/TableTime-Final_Build/archive/refs/tags/Beta.zip) prior to the additon of the previously mentioned bug. In order to test it, when signing up for an account, but sure to use you RCSID as the username as it looks to that to determing the delivery address.

***Plans Going Forward***:

The inital idea for TableTime was concieved pre-Covid and was intended to find tables in a very packed Union. Initially the idea was to be pitched to RCOS and started from scratch, but COVID happened and the plan was put on backlog. Having made a significant amount of headway in WebSystems, the group has decided that it would be a good idea to put this as a potential RCOS project. The plan is to pitch the concept in January to RCOS as a potential project given the work done thus far and hopefully see an end product in action by the end of next semester.
