          <p>As someone with first-generation immigrant parents, communication is integral to my life. I'm fascinated by how technology has lessened the burden of language barriers but still strive to refine my interpersonal communication skills.

          <h2>Divya Bachina</h2>
          <p class="title"> Front-End Developer</p>
          <p> Divya Bachina is a senior majoring in Information Technology and Web Science with a concentration in Finance. As an ambidextrous person, I find myself often naturally balancing my writing: left hand to right hand. In a sense, this is a great analogy for my skill sets; balancing qualitative and quantitative tasks; programming analysis and project management come natural to me. While I have a strong quantitative background in engineering and computer science; in addition to creating new product ideas and gauging public interests, I find joy in quantifying those with market segmentation and analysis using Python and R. In a sense, I fit best in the marriage of both technical and non-technical tasks, as I am able to see the interests in both sides.</p>
